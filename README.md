# Project price calculator

## Purpose

*“So what will this actually cost to build and run?”*

I made this tool for simple "back of napkin" calculations for on pricing to build out a software project 
and rough estimates of the infra costs behind it. 

Also wanted to play with Loveable on something that isn't super "important."

## To Run

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## To make changes

Default settings are saved in [/src/config/defaults.json](/src/config/defaults.json). 

Feel free to change them to suit your needs.
